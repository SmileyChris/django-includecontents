namespaced: true
description: Status message banner with tone-specific styling and optional dismiss control.
best_practices: |
  - Use alerts sparingly for significant feedback rather than routine confirmations.
  - Pair dismissible alerts with state persistence so the message does not immediately reappear.
accessibility: |
  - Provide a succinct `title` that summarizes the message for screen reader users.
  - Ensure the dismiss button receives focus order immediately after the alert for keyboard users.
