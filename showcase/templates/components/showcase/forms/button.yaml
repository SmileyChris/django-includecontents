name: Button
category: Forms
description: Action button with flavor variants, sizing, and disabled support for the showcase gallery.
best_practices: |
  - Keep copy short and verb-focused so buttons read as actions.
  - Pair destructive variants with a confirmation step or undo affordance.
accessibility: |
  - Supply an `aria-label` when the button contents rely on iconography alone.
  - Communicate disabled states in adjacent copy because screen readers announce the control as unavailable.
