name: Form Input
category: Showcase
description: Labeled text field with optional help text, placeholders, and required indicator for form demos.
best_practices: |
  - Match the `name` with your form backing field or context key so submissions serialize correctly.
  - Reserve placeholder text for short hints rather than duplicating the label.
accessibility: |
  - Every input should have a descriptive `label` so assistive tech announces the control.
  - Use `help_text` to surface validation requirements that are not obvious from the label alone.
