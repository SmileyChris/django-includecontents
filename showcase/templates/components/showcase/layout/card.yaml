name: Card
category: Showcase
description: Structured container with optional header, footer, borders, and configurable shadow depth.
best_practices: |
  - Keep titles short so the header wraps to at most two lines on smaller screens.
  - Use the footer region for secondary actions like metadata or links rather than duplicating primary actions.
accessibility: |
  - Ensure the card contents maintain heading hierarchy and semantic markup instead of relying on visual styling alone.
  - When cards are interactive, render them as an anchor or button instead of relying on click handlers on the wrapper.
